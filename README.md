# TelegramSDK_php

This is a work-in-progress SDK for developing Telegram applications using the PHP programming language. It simplifies the development process for creating Telegram bots, helping developers quickly and easily build and deploy their bots.

## Features

* Easy-to-use API for sending and receiving messages
* Support for both long-polling and webhooks
* Extensive callbacks with many filters
* Detailed documentation and comprehensive examples (coming soon)

## Documentation

Full documentation for using the SDK is currently not in progress. I will get to it when I am done with the development of the basic SDK.
